GOBP_NECROPTOTIC_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	> A series of molecular signals which triggers the necroptotic death of a cell. The pathway starts with reception of a signal, is characterized by activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and/or 3 (RIPK1/3, also called RIP1/3), and ends when the execution phase of necroptosis is triggered.
